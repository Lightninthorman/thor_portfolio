    <h2>MoGraph Projects</h2>

    <p>I've always found motion graphics and VFX to be interesting and inspiring. Anything you imagine is possible. MoGraph is a hobby of mine and most of the examples below were created as a way to learn different tools in After Effects.</p>
    <p>Check out my tumblr repository for more than what's listed below: <a href="https://lightninthorman.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">My Tumblr</a> </p>

                <h3>Adam & Eve Music Video</h3>
                <p>Project for a local musician. I wanted to combine live footage with my mograph project. I had my second child during this project, which made finding free time a bit of a challenge.</p>

                <p>Volunteered my time to create this promo for the Massachusetts Breast Cancer Coalition. I also made a spanish version.</p>

                <h3>Futura Project</h3>
                <p>A fun project for a course I was taking in video production. In theory this was based on the font type Futura.</p>

                <h3>Demon Face</h3>
                <p>Just a simple test to see if I could learn how to do some face distortion. Sound effects added for the heck of it.</p>
